# kuncheva-index
Given the new trends surrounding Ensemble Feature Selection and the needs of comparing discrepancies between different rankings generated by function or data perturbation, this repository aims to implement a correct and reliable Python version of the Kuncheva Index measure proposed by Ludmila I. Kuncheva.  A stability index for feature selection.  In Artificial Intelligence and Applications (AIAP’07), pages 390–395, 2007.

The goal is to provide easy to use methods for computing the stability of a given list or Pandas dataset. [TODO: explain the formats of I/O]
